## Framework Overview
D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents. It is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Mike Bostock to create custom interactive data visualizations in the web browser using SVG, HTML and CSS.
Data - Provided by you
Driven - d3 connects data to documents
Documents - web-based documents
### Pre-requisites: HTML, Javascript, Jquery, SVG and CSS

### features
      - Data Driven Visualisations: D3 is a framework that is also a visualization library for building-data driven graphics. 
      It lets you build graphics that use common web standards
      
      - Using Open Web Standards: It makes the graphics easily accessible through any web browser.And that means that one can
      use JavaScript and generate regular HTML and CSS visualizations and the slightly and more flexible, 
      scalable vector graphics known as SVG.
         
      - Works With Modern Broswers: D3 library is very lightweight and works well across all the browsers.
      It is capable of handling large data sets.
      
      - Dynamic Properties: D3 gives the flexibility to provide dynamic properties to most of its functions. 
      Properties can be specified as functions of data. That means your data can drive your styles and attributes.
      
     - Types of visualization: With D3, there are no standard visualization formats. But it enables you to create
     anything from an HTML table to a Pie chart, from graphs and bar charts to geospatial maps.
     
     - Custom Visualizations: Since D3 works with web standards, it gives you complete control over your visualization features.
     
     - Transitions: D3 provides the transition() function. This is quite powerful because internally, D3 works out the logic to              interpolate between your values and find the intermittent states.
     
     - Interaction and animation: D3 provides great support for animation with functions like duration(), 
     delay() and ease(). Animations from one state to another are fast and responsive to user interactions.
